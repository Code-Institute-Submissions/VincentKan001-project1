Project Name: Website for Elite Fight Club (Vincent Kan Project 1)

Elite Fight Club is a Professional Muay Thai and MMA Gym that originated from Bangkok, Thailand. I've been to the gym for training and had a pleasant experience.
It is a place where lovers of the sport can go to have a tougher training since it is Thailand's national sport. Students and fighters will find themselves getting fitter and 
see a drastic improvement in their techniques regardless of whether they are training professionally or just for fun. 

I first got to know of the gym as it was introduced to me by a friend of mine residing in Thailand so I decided go there and take a look. There are many of such gyms in Thailand,
however I find them different as people of all ages, gender and proficiencies help each other out under the guidance of the professional coaches there hence it is a happy place where
martial art lovers can improve in their sport as well as meet people of similar interests around the world. 

I embarked on this project as I would like to share my passion with everyone who visits my website and of course for those are are eager to try out the gym, its for me to share more information with them. 


UX:

This website is meant for people who are curious about the world of Muay Thai and Mix Martial Arts and who are eager to try it out. Where else could be a better place besides country the sport originated from.
I believe that people who comes to my website have either heard of Elite Fight Club or they are just curious and want to know more about the sport and how a typical day of training is like in Thailand. 

My website aims to provide users or visitors in depth information about the gym, its location, its training style and most importantly whether or not they themselves are suitable for the sport.
People who goes to Bangkok are usually on vacation or "train-cation" hence the website aims to shows users how to get to the gym, how convenient it is to get there, how is their schedule like,
how much does it cost and of course what kind of training do they provide. 

As a user when i enter into a gym website, there are afew things which are important to me which i hope to be able to locate in an instant. some examples are:
1. Where is the gym located ? 
2. Do they have multiple outlets?
3. Is it accessible by public transport?
4.
